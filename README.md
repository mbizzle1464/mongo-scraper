# Sport Scraper
***
This is a web based application that scrapes Sports Articles from USA Today and then allows users to comment on these articles. 

### Motivation

The goal was to create a sports website where fans can find a trusted news outlet while also conversing on a safe environment. Sports Scraper is not affiliated with USA Today or any of it's ancillary companies.

### UI/UX

Sport Scraper is designed to be minimalistic. The soft grays allow the eye to asthetic view the page while the bright buttons and pictures allow the user to freely view each card separate from one another. 

Keeping it simple with standard Bootstrap font, the user can enjoy this site without having to wonder off elsewhere.
